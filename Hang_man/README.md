How to run my code:
1. Run the "hanman.sql" to create data base.
2. Open and Run the "HangManServer.java"
3. Once the console shows it is connected, pull up the terminal of your computer, goes to the A4-5/bin.
4. Run "java HangManClient".

This homework really takes me a large amount of time. There might be some minor mistakes like mis-spelling or 
missing a colon or space in the server/client output but I believe I have all the correct outputs and functionalities required. This homework is already hard by nature so I hope I don't lose point on some trivial things :P
